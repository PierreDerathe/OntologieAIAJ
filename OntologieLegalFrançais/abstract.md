## Building Legal Ontologies with METHONTOLOGY and WebODE

This paper presents how to build an ontology in the legal domain following the ontology development methodology METHONTOLOGY. Its inherent ease-of-use (graphical and tabular intermediate representations), allowing legal experts without technical knowledge in ontological engineering to actively participate in its development.

## LKIF core: Principled ontology development for the legal domain
Describe a legal core ontology that is part of LKIF: a representation that enables the translation between different legal knowledge bases. Can be used as the basis for other legals ontologies.

## Core concepts of law: taking common-sense seriously
The LRI-Core ontology is proposed as a core ontology for legal domains. LRI-Core adopts a common-sense grounding, asserting that legal concepts still derive meaning from everyday reasoning and cognitive plausibility.

LKIF is probably a successor and finalised version of LRI-Core

## Using Ontologies to Model Data Protection Requirements in Workflows

Propose an ontology on the data protection domain. 
Reuse LKIF and SKOS(Simple Knowledge Organization System)

## Legal Ontologies for the Spanish e-Government

Government faces considerable challenges to achieve interoperability
given the semantic differences of interpretation, complexity and width of scope.

Present an e-Government ontology model; a set of legal ontologies on the Real-estate transaction domain is used to illustrate.

## A legal case OWL ontology with an instantiation of Popov v. Hayashi

Propose an ontology for legal cases with an instantiation. A populated ontology is a case base which can be used for information retrieval, information extraction, and case based reasoning.

Use the Protégé ontology editor and knowledge acquisition system, current guidelines for ontology development, and tools for visual and linguistic presentation of the ontology.

## LOTED2: An ontology of European public procurement notices

LOTED2 ontology for the representation of European public procurement notices with the goal of integration of laws from multiple jurisdictions. Designed to support the creation of Semantic Web applications.

Compromise between the accurate representation, usability and creating connections to other ontologies.

## Towards a Legal Rule-Based System Grounded on the Integration of Criminal Domain Ontology and Rules

Construct a legal rulebased decision support system, using a criminal domain ontology and set of logic rules.

## Judging Amy: Automated legal assessment using OWL 2

Describe OWL Judge, a Protégé 4 plugin, that uses standard OWL 2 DL reasoning for legal assessment on  the LKIF core ontology. 

## Automatic Extraction of Metrics from SLAs for Cloud Service Management

Describe the automated process of extracting, managing and monitoring cloud SLA(Service Level Agreements) using natural language processing techniques and Semantic Web technologies. 

## A multi-agent legal recommender system

Describes the Infonorma requirements specification, the architectural design solution for those requirements, the detailed design of the Filter agent and the implementation model of Infonorma
